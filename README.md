# Fintech Ops Platform

A complete Financial Operations, Reconciliation, Risk Analysis, and Business Analytics platform that simulates the internal systems of a global fintech or digital bank.

This project was built to demonstrate hands-on experience aligned with Business Analyst (Finance), Fintech Operations, Product Analyst, and Payments/Crypto-related roles.

## Elevator Pitch (60 seconds)

I built a fintech operations platform that simulates how digital banks process transactions end-to-end — from user payments and ledger accounting to external settlements, reconciliation workflows, risk detection, and KPI monitoring.

The project reflects real-world financial operations, showing how analysts ensure financial integrity, detect anomalies, reconcile balances, and generate insights for business and regulatory decision-making.

## Business Problem Simulated

Modern fintechs must ensure that every user transaction is accurately recorded internally, that external settlement providers match internal records, that financial discrepancies are detected quickly, that risks and anomalies are monitored, and that business KPIs are available for decision-making.

This project simulates these challenges using structured data, SQL analytics, and documented workflows.
